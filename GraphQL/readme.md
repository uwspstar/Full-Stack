Facebook and get hub are using graphical in production today.
It provides the speed and flexibility needed for real world applications.
```
- GraphQL API is flexible , just change query
- GraphQL API is much simpler to maintain 
```
- GraphQL creates fast and flexible APIs, giving clients complete control 
to ask for just the data they need.
- This results in fewer HTP requests flexible data querying 
and in general less code to manage.
