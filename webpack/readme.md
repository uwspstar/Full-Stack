The purpose of webpack is :
to take our big collection of tiny little javascript modules and merge them all into one big javascript file 
while also ensuring that each module is executed in the correct order.
```
- $>npm init --yes
```
In the world of JavaScript modules,
each module - or each file that we create - has its own separate scope.
That is, code that we want to add or access inside of one file.
```
- exports NOT export
- CommonJs (require , module.exports)
- AMD (require, define)
- ES2015 (import, export)
