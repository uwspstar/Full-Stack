- This is especially important on macOS, where you already got Python 2.7 pre-installed. 
To NOT use that, run **python3**  instead of python .

- Unlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content:
```
>>> cubes = [1, 8, 27, 65, 125]  # something's wrong here
>>> 4 ** 3  # the cube of 4 is 64, not 65!
64
>>> cubes[3] = 64  # replace the wrong value
>>> cubes
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
```
- 2 ** 7  # 2 to the power of 7 # 128
- String literals can span multiple lines. One way is using triple-quotes: """...""" or '''...'''. 
- word[2:5]  # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)
- Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. 
This makes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s:
- the length of word[1:3] is 2
```
word = 'python'
>>> word[:2]   # character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded)
'Py'
>>> word[4:]   # characters from position 4 (included) to the end
'on'
>>> word[-2:]  # characters from the second-last (included) to the end
'on'
```
- len(s)
```
All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. 
This means that the following slice returns a new (shallow) copy of the list:

>>> squares[:]
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

- Python Enhancement Proposal #8, otherwise known as PEP 8
- if name == "abc": // NOT if(name =="abc" ):
- style  //care for the line space // 
- >indentation is 4 space
- Use spaces instead of tabs for indentation.
- Lines should be 79 characters in length or less
- In a file, functions and classes should be separated by two blank lines.
- In a class, methods should be separated by one blank line.
- Don’t put spaces around list indexes, function calls, or keyword argument
assignments.
- Put one—and only one—space before and after variable assignments.
- Functions, variables, and attributes should be in lowercase_underscore
format.
- Protected instance attributes should be in _leading_underscore format.
- Private instance attributes should be in __double_leading_underscore
format.
- Classes and exceptions should be in CapitalizedWord format
- Module-level constants should be in ALL_CAPS format
- Instance methods in classes should use self as the name of the first parameter
(which refers to the object).
- Class methods should use cls as the name of the first parameter (which refers to
the class).
- Don’t check for empty values (like [] or '') by checking the length (if
len(somelist) == 0).
- Avoid single-line if statements, for and while loops, and except compound
statements.
- Always put import statements at the top of a file.
```
print("hello world")
print("input your name")

def display_name(name):

        print(f"name is :{name} not a")

```
- In Python 3, there are two types that represent sequences of characters: bytes and str.
- Instances of bytes contain raw 8-bit values. 
- Instances of str contain Unicode
- There are many ways to represent Unicode characters as binary data (raw 8-bit values).
The most common encoding is UTF-8.
- In Python 3, you’ll need one method that takes a str or bytes and always returns a
str.
```
def to_str(bytes_or_str):
    if isinstance(bytes_or_str, bytes):
        value = bytes_or_str.decode(‘utf-8’)
    else:
        value = bytes_or_str
    return value # Instance of str
```
- You’ll need another method that takes a str or bytes and always returns a bytes.
```
def to_str(bytes_or_str):
    if isinstance(bytes_or_str, bytes):
        value = bytes_or_str.decode(‘utf-8’)
    else:
        value = bytes_or_str
    return value # Instance of str
```
- In Python 3, bytes and str instances are never equivalent—
not even the empty string
- In Python 3, bytes contains sequences of 8-bit values, str contains sequences of
Unicode characters. bytes and str instances can’t be used together with operators
(like > or +).

```
a = [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’, ‘e’, ‘f’, ‘g’, ‘h’]
print(‘First four:’, a[:4])
print(‘Last four: ‘, a[-4:])
print(‘Middle two:’, a[3:-3])
>>>
First four: [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’]
Last four: [‘e’, ‘f’, ‘g’, ‘h’]
Middle two: [‘d’, ‘e’]

```
- When slicing from the start of a list, you should leave out the zero index to reduce visual
noise.
```assert a[:5] == a[0:5]```
- the expression somelist[-0:] will result in a copy of the original list.
- The result of slicing a list is a whole new list. References to the objects from the original
list are maintained. Modifying the result of slicing won’t affect the original list.
- Don’t supply 0 for the start index or the length of the
sequence for the end index.
- ```somelist[start:end:stride]```
- ::2 means select every second item starting at the beginning. Trickier, ::-2
means select every second item starting at the end and moving backwards.
```
a[2::2] # [‘c’, ‘e’, ‘g’]
a[-2::-2] # [‘g’, ‘e’, ‘c’, ‘a’]
a[-2:2:-2] # [‘g’, ‘e’]
a[2:2:-2] # []
```

- x not in y
- Python Bitwise Operators
- https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/bitwise_operators_example.htm
```
Operator	Name	Description
-------------------------------------------------
& 	AND	Sets each bit to 1 if both bits are 1
|	OR	Sets each bit to 1 if one of two bits is 1
^	XOR	Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
~ 	NOT	Inverts all the bits
<<	Zero fill left shift	Shift left by pushing zeros in from the right and let the leftmost bits fall off
>>	Signed right shift	Shift right by pushing copies of the leftmost bit in from the left, and let the rightmost bits fall off

- remove vs. del vs. pop
```
Yes, remove removes the first matching value, not a specific index:

>>> a = [0, 2, 3, 2]
>>> a.remove(2)
>>> a
[0, 3, 2]
del removes the item at a specific index:

>>> a = [3, 2, 2, 1]
>>> del a[1]
>>> a
[3, 2, 1]
and pop removes the item at a specific index and returns it.

>>> a = [4, 3, 5]
>>> a.pop(1)
3
>>> a
[4, 5]
```
- remove val in list
```

        nums.remove(val)
