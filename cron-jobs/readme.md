```
"Cron" is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems (Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS etc...). 
And these jobs or tasks are referred to as "Cron Jobs".
```
```
There is a cron "daemon" that runs on these systems. 
A daemon is a program that runs in the background all the time, usually initiated by the system. 
This cron daemon is responsible for launching these cron jobs on schedule.
