#  Cloud Computing
### On Premise Data Center , What is Cloud Computing
### Data Center (DC) Components 
- IFNWS3 ( IF North West South 3)
- Network
- Security
- Servers (compute)
- WAN
- Internet
- Storage
- File Sharing
### load balancing
- in computing, load balancing distributes workloads across multiple computing resources, such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units or disk drivers. Load balancing aimes to optimized resource use, maximize throughtput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource.
- Generally speaking where the requests will come and then the load balancer will be smart enough to find out that this server is has has more cycles get having less load too I will send the request to be processed by this network.
### DC multi tenancy
- multi tenancy and a very important aspect of multi tenancy is security.
- Is the ability to host multiple clients/users on the Same infrastructure, while maintaining isolation And security for each tenant. This implies virtualizing The network, services, compute/servers, and storage
### Servers - Physical 
- server /a physical standalone rack accountable server  
- blade
- cha
### Servers - Virtual
- one of these virtual server a virtual machine in ASW as this is called the elastic compute cloud or the EC2 service.
- be able to save on cooling you would be able to save on power you would be able to save on
### Servers - Virtual Memory, CPU, NIC, DISK
- a ```virtualization layer``` or called ```hypervisor```.
### Virtualization
- All can be virtualized Networ, Storage, Security, SLB, 
### Cloud Computing - Definition
- Cloud computing often referred to as the cloud is the delivery of on demand computing resources everything from applications to data centers over the Internet as pay for use basis.
- Cloud computing is a type of computing that relies on sharing computing resources rather than having local servers or personal devices to handle applications.
- Cloud computing is a kind of Internet based computing that provides shared processing for resources and data to computers and other devices on demand
### Cloud computing offerings
- Software as a Service (Saas) -- CRM, Microsoft Office 365 PowerPoint, in the cloud and people can subscribe to it.
- Database as a Service (Daas)
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
- Infrastructure as a Service (LaaS)  -- AWS No1
### Cloud deployment models
- HybridCloud ( PRivate Cloud , Public Cloud)
- ```Private cloud``` is for a single tenant
- ```Public cloud```, as the name implies, is shared among multiple tenants
- ```Hybrid cloud``` is the composition of two or more private & public clouds
- public cloud is all about. So Automated Access customer managed access to services whether it's infrastructure as a service platform and service or software as a service private cloud.
- When the client builds the to me to cloud setup but ```in-house``` This is called ```private cloud``` 
- hybrid cloud  basically the setup that encompasses public cloud tenancy and private cloud.
### Cloud vs On-Premise
- OPEX( operational expenditure ) vs CAPEX, Pay for what you use
- Time to deploy
- Dev and Test environments made easier
- Flexibility of Changes
- Elasticity
- Automation
### Cons : Lack of visibility (where is your Data)
