- in computing, load balancing distributes workloads across multiple computing resources, such as computers, a computer cluster, network links, central processing units or disk drivers. Load balancing aimes to optimized resource use, maximize throughtput, minimize response time, and avoid overload of any single resource.
- Generally speaking where the requests will come and then the load balancer will be smart enough to find out that this server is has has more cycles get having less load too I will send the request to be processed by this network.
