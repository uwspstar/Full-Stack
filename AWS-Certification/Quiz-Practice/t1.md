- A Solutions Architect is deploying an ```Auto Scaling Group (ASG)``` and needs to determine what CloudWatch monitoring option to use. Which of the statements below would assist the Architect in making his decision? (choose 2) ```2,5```  
1.Detailed monitoring is free and can be manually enabled   
2.Detailed monitoring is enabled by default if the ASG is created from the CLI   
3.Basic monitoring is enabled by default if the ASG is created from the CLI   
4.Detailed monitoring is chargeable and must always be manually enabled   
5.Basic monitoring is enabled by default if the ASG is created from the console   
```
Basic monitoring sends EC2 metrics to CloudWatch about ASG instances every 5 minutes
Detailed can be enabled and sends metrics every 1 minute (it is always chargeable)
When the launch configuration is created from the CLI detailed monitoring of EC2 instances is enabled by default
When you enable Auto Scaling group metrics, Auto Scaling sends sampled data to CloudWatch every minute
```
