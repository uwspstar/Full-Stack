###A research company is developing a data lake solution in Amazon S3 to analyze huge datasets. The solution makes infrequent SQL queries only. In addition, the company wants to minimize infrastructure costs.

Which AWS service should be used to meet these requirements?
```
 Amazon Athena
 Amazon Redshift Spectrum
 Amazon RDS for MySQL
 Amazon Aurora
```
### A manufacturing company captures data from machines running at customer sites. Currently, thousands of machines send data every 5 minutes, and this is expected to grow to hundreds of thousands of machines in the near future. The data is logged with the intent to be analyzed in the future as needed. What is the SIMPLEST method to store this streaming data at scale?
- Create an Amazon EC2 instance farm behind an ELB to store the data in Amazon EBS Cold HDD volumes
- Create an Amazon SQS queue, and have the machines write to the queue
- Create an Amazon Kinesis Firehose delivery stream to store the data in Amazon S3 (Correct)
- Create an Auto Scaling Group of Amazon EC2 instances behind ELBs to write data into Amazon RDS
```
Kinesis Data Firehose is the easiest way to load streaming data into data stores and analytics tools. 
It captures, transforms, and loads streaming data 
and you can deliver the data to “destinations” including Amazon S3 buckets for later analysis

Writing data into RDS via a series of EC2 instances and a load balancer is more complex and more expensive. 
RDS is also not an ideal data store for this data

Using an SQS queue to store the data is not possible 
as the data needs to be stored long-term 
and SQS queues have a maximum retention time of 14 days

Storing the data in EBS wold be expensive 
and as EBS volumes cannot be shared by multiple instances 
you would have a bottleneck of a single EC2 instance writing the data
```
### A Solutions Architect is deploying an ```Auto Scaling Group (ASG)``` and needs to determine what CloudWatch monitoring option to use. Which of the statements below would assist the Architect in making his decision? (choose 2) ```2,5```  
- Detailed monitoring is free and can be manually enabled   
- Detailed monitoring is enabled by default if the ASG is created from the CLI   
- Basic monitoring is enabled by default if the ASG is created from the CLI   
- Detailed monitoring is chargeable and must always be manually enabled   
- Basic monitoring is enabled by default if the ASG is created from the console   
```
Basic monitoring sends EC2 metrics to CloudWatch about ASG instances every 5 minutes
Detailed can be enabled and sends metrics every 1 minute (it is always chargeable)
When the launch configuration is created from the CLI 
detailed monitoring of EC2 instances is enabled by default
When you enable Auto Scaling group metrics, 
Auto Scaling sends sampled data to CloudWatch every minute
```
