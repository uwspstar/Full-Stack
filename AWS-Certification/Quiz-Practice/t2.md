### An application hosted in your VPC uses an EC2 instance with a MySQL DB running on it. The database uses a single 1TB General Purpose SSD (GP2) EBS volume. Recently it has been noticed that the database is not performing well and you need to improve the read performance. What are two possible ways this can be achieved? (choose 2)   
- Use a provisioned IOPS volume and specify the number of I/O operations required   (Correct)
- Add multiple EBS volumes in a RAID 1 array   
- Add multiple EBS volumes in a RAID 0 array   (Correct)
- Create an active/passive cluster using MySQL   
- Add an RDS read replica in another AZ   
```
Explanation
RAID 0 = 0 striping – data is written across multiple disks 
and increases performance but no redundancy

RAID 1 = 1 mirroring – creates 2 copies of the data 
but does not increase performance, only redundancy

SSD, Provisioned IOPS – I01 provides higher performance than General Purpose SSD (GP2) 
and you can specify the IOPS required up to 50 IOPS per GB and a maximum of 32000 IOPS

RDS read replicas cannot be created from EC2 instances

Creating an active/passive cluster doesn't improve read performance
as the passive node is not servicing requests. 
This is use for fault tolerance
