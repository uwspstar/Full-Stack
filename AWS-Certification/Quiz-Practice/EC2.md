B. high-performance storage of user files 
C. storing critical system files
D. non-persistent data
```

### Amazon provides durable, block-level storage volumes you can attach to a running instance and which persist beyond the life of the instance.
```
A. Elastic Block Store
B. Elastic File System
C. Persistent Block Store 
D. EC2 Instance Store
```
### An Elastic Cloud Compute (EC2) instance can be best described as
