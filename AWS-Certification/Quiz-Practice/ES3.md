### All objects by default are private. Only the object owner has permission to access these objects. However, the object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a pre-signed URL, using their own security credentials, to grant time-limited permission to download the objects.

Anyone who receives the pre-signed URL can then access the object. For example, if you have a video in your bucket and both the bucket and the object are private, you can share the video with others by generating a pre-signed URL.
