### What’s AWS?
- AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a Cloud Provider
- They provide you with servers and services that you can use on demand and scale easily

### AWS Regions
- AWS has regions all around the world
(us-east-1)
- Each region has availability zones (us-east-1a, us-east-1b…)
- Each availability zone is a physical data center in the region, 
but separate from the other ones (so that they’re isolated
from disasters)
- AWS Consoles are region scoped
(except IAM, S3 & Route53)
