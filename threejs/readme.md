```
display anything with three.js, we need three things: 
- scene
- renderer
- camera, 
so that we can render the scene with camera.
```

- There are a few different cameras in three.js. such as PerspectiveCamera.
- $>npm init --yes
- $>npm i three

- $>python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...```
```
OR
$> npm install -g http-server
$> http-server
Starting up http-server, serving ./ on port: 8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server

Alternatively you can also use the Simple HTTP Server option:

$> npm install -g simple-http-server
$> nserver
simple-http-server Now Serving: /Users/jos/git/Physijs at http://
localhost:8000/
```
