### Basic
- In general use, controllers are called via a URL, they execute your custom code, and they return a view
- usually return the appropriate ActionResult, which handles things such as HTTP status codes, calling the View templating system, and so on.
- input parameter embed it directly within the URL itself
- ASP.NET MVC’s default routing convention is to treat the segment of a URL after the action method name as a parameter named ID.
-  a controller class was that it inherits from System.Web.Mvc.Controller. 
-  controllers are really at the heart. Every request goes through a controller, whereas some will not need to make use of models and views.
- We’re using the HttpUtility.HtmlEncode utility method to sanitize the user input. This prevents users from injecting JavaScript code or HTML markup into our view
- M odels: Classes that represent the data of the application and that use validation logic to enforce business rules for that data.
- V iews: Template files that your application uses to dynamically generate HTML responses.
- C ontrollers: Classes that handle incoming browser requests, retrieve model data, and then specify view templates that return a response to the browser.
- HttpUtility.HtmlEncode to protect the application from malicious input (namely JavaScript).
- In ASP.NET MVC applications, it's more typical to pass in parameters as route data (like we did with ID above) than passing them as query strings.
- A view template should never perform business logic or interact with a database directly.
- ViewBag is a dynamic object, which means you can put whatever you want in to it
- the view model approach to passing data is generally much preferred over the view bag approach
-  ViewBag is useful when you want to pass information not related to the view model and you don’t want to create a view model just to pass the information.
- get in the habit of checking that Add Unit Tests box for every project you create.

### Code
-  You could supply a different view name, as follows:
```
public ActionResult Index() {   return View("NotIndex"); }
```

- You can use the tilde syntax to provide the full path to the view, as follows:
```
public ActionResult Index() {   return View("~/Views/Example/Index.cshtml"); }

When using the tilde syntax, you must supply the file extension of the view 
because this bypasses the view engine’s internal lookup mechanism for fi nding views


```
-  strongly typed views allow you to set a model type for a view. 
```
@using MvcMusicStore.Models 
@model IEnumerable<Album>

An even better approach for namespaces, which you’ll end up using often in views, 
is to declare the namespace in the web.config fi le within the Views directory.

<system.web.webPages.razor> 
… 
<pages pageBaseType="System.Web.Mvc.WebViewPage">   
  <namespaces>     
    <add namespace="System.Web.Mvc" />     
    <add namespace="System.Web.Mvc.Ajax" />     
    <add namespace="System.Web.Mvc.Html" />     
    <add namespace="System.Web.Routing" />
    <add namespace="MvcMusicStore.Models" />   
  </namespaces> 
</pages> 
</system.web.webPages.razor>

```
