# JSON
### Working with JSON
- Since JSON is nothing more than a string, it can be used to store data in a text file or
transfer data via an HTTP requests between two machines.

### JavaScript provides two methods for working with JSON. 
- The first is ```JSON.stringify``` and the second is ```JSON.parse```. 
- ```JSON.stringify``` converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string
- ```JSON.parse``` converts a JSON string into a JavaScript object
