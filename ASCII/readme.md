# ASCII ( American Standard Code )
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII
```
abbreviated from American Standard Code for Information Interchange, 
is a character encoding standard for electronic communication. ASCII codes represent text in computers, 
telecommunications equipment, and other devices. 
Most modern character-encoding schemes are based on ASCII, although they support many additional characters.
```
- Originally based on the English alphabet, ASCII encodes 128 specified characters into seven-bit integers as shown by the ASCII chart above
- 95 of the encoded characters are printable: 
  - these include the digits 0 to 9, 
  - lowercase letters a to z, 
  - uppercase letters A to Z, and 
  - punctuation symbols.

- For example, lowercase i would be represented in the ASCII encoding by binary 1101001 = hexadecimal 69 (i is the ninth letter) = decimal 105.
