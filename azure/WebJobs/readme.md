WebJobs SDK versions
These are the key differences between version 3.x and version 2.x of the WebJobs SDK:

Version 3.x adds support for .NET Core.
In version 3.x, you need to explicitly install the Storage binding extension required by the WebJobs SDK. 
In version 2.x, the Storage bindings were included in the SDK.
Visual Studio tooling for .NET Core (3.x) projects differs from tooling for .NET Framework (2.x) projects.
