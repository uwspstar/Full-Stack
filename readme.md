### Consider this architecture style for:

- Large applications that require a high release velocity.
- Complex applications that need to be highly scalable.
- Applications with rich domains or many subdomains.
- An organization that consists of small development teams.

  - If you want transparency : use a PNG 
  - if you want animations : use a GIF 
  - if you want colorful detailed images : use a JPEG
  - if you want simple icons, logos, and illustrations : use a SVGs.
  - Reduce PNG with TinyPNG
  - Reduce JPG with JPEG-optimizer
  - Try to choose simple illustrations over highly detailed photos
  - Always lower JPEG image quality (30~60%)
  - Resize image based on size it will be displayed
  - Display different sized images for different backgrounds.
  - Use CDNs like imigx
  - Remove image metadata
  
```
you can convert SVG into Base64 encoding, and that works as the Data URI 

HTML 
<img alt="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDo etc">
<img src='data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg ... > ... </svg>'>

CSS
.bg {
  background: url('data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg ...> ... </svg>');
}
```

# NETWORK
- #### tracert / traceroute

Open up the Terminal (Mac), or Command Prompt (Windows) and run traceroute on any website you want. 
Keep in mind that on windows you will have to run tracert instead of traceroute

run:  tracert -4 google.com  //which forces IPv4 hops

- #### ping / telnet

```
ping <IP Address>
  
Telnet <IP Address> 13531
```

# Communication Protocols

# SSH
- HTTPS vs SSH
>The “S,” then, provides an additional protocol for security; in fact HTTPS actually stands for HTTP over SSL (Secure Socket Layer). The most basic understanding of SSH (Secure Shell) is that you are remotely logging into another computer.
- SSL vs SSH
>SSL & SSH, both are public key cryptography tunneling protocols and aims to secure confidential data. SSL Secure Socket Layer is a certificate for protecting data on the net, SSH, Secure Shell, is a network application used to transfer or share data with a remote computer.
```
SSH {user}@{host}

- Windows:

- Symmetric vs. Asymmetric
>Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Systems. Recall that there are two basic types of encryption: symmetric algorithms: (also called “secret key”) use the same key for both encryption and decryption; asymmetric algorithms: (also called “public key”) use different keys for encryption and decryption.
