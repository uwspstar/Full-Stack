### Class vs Structure
```
- classes are reference types allocated on the heap
- structures are value types allocated on the stack.

*** The main difference between structures and classes is that 
- structures implemented this semantic of copying by value 
- classes implement as a semantic of copying by a reference.
```

### Array vs ArrayList
